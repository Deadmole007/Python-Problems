Q 1 Write a Python function to create the HTML string with tags around the word(s).
Sample function and result : 
add_tags('i', 'Python') -> '<i>Python</i>'
add_tags('b', 'Python Tutorial') -> '<b>Python Tutorial </b>'

Q2 Write a Python function to insert a string in the middle of a string.
Sample function and result : 
insert_sting_middle('[[]]<<>>', 'Python') -> [[Python]]
insert_sting_middle('{{}}', 'PHP') -> {{PHP}}

Q3 Write a Python function to reverses a string if it's length is a multiple of 4.

Q4 Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not.

Q5 Write a Python function that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle. 
Note : Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal.

Pascal's triangle
Each number is the two numbers above it added together 

Q6 Write a Python function to check whether a string is a pangram or not. 
Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" 

Q7 Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically. 
Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white
Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow

Q8 Write a Python function to create and print a list where the values are square of numbers between 0 and 29 (both included).

Q9 Write a Python program to access a function inside a function.

Q10 Write a Python function to check whether a number is perfect or not. 
Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.
